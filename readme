### FLAPPY BIRD

I chose FlappyBird out of 100s of retro games out there because I was very pressed on time haha.
Jokes aside,

It is true I chose the game because I was tight on time due to some recent research works. 
However, I believe this game shows how a simple idea can make a lasting impact. Creating Fun - does not always need to be too unique or overengineered.
Also, I have an idea for a sidescrolling game with a similar theme (ofc a bit more complex), and I wanted to transition from this to my idea eventually.


The game although simple uses some of the key ideas of making games in Unity.

- The Player is the 'Flappy Bird' 
- Prefabs: The obstacles (pipes) are prefab. The scoring zone is also part of the same prefab. 
- Scene Transitions
- There is no direct Level. As the player scores higher the speed of the pipes spawning gets faster. That's it.
